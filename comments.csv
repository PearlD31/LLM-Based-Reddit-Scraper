seeing people say that alphafold is going to make people lose their jobs pains me,"Scientific journals get wet when they see electron density maps, a picture of the protein crystal, and crystallographic factors such as space group, resolution, completeness, and unit cell dimensions and number of water molecules in crystal lattice.

Pain in this area from pipetting? Any tips for avoiding or treating this?,"Wear a brace! I had a similar issue (still do to some capacity but it's hugely improved). My method was to wear the brace full time when I first started and the pain was worst, and that includes during lab work. If you get a brace that immobilizes the wrist but leaves your fingers free you should be able to pipette and a glove a size larger will fit over it. Over time I eased up and only wore it for strenuous activity that I knew would irritate it, then I switched to a less supportive brace, then I stopped wearing the brace altogether and I've been able to work well in the lab. When I have a flare now I immediately get back into the brace full time for a few days to rest it and it goes back to baseline.

It also helps if you can find ergonomic solutions like electronic pipettes and repeat pipettes to make the work less rough to supplement this, but honestly once I got my condition under control I moved to a new job where I currently don't have electronic pipettes and I haven't noticed it getting worse.",1,https://i.redd.it/h1blzxx8mdoa1.jpg

"For those who work with mice, do you notice a behavioral or personality difference for different strains?","There used to be a very prominent field of mouse genetics work (now unfortunately replaced by human genetics with mouse genetics forgotten), where all they would do is characterize the behaviors, physiology, etc. of different mouse strains. Nowadays groups will use inbred mouse panels for genetic mapping studies to understand the genetic basis of certain behaviors (think GWAS but in mice).

So it's widely known that genetically different strains of mice behave differently. Coolest thing was that the same strains' behavior reported literally decades ago, in different countries, behave very similarly today as they did back then!

"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","**Full context:** Was using liquid nitrogen in the lab and wasn't being as careful (or as intelligent) as I should've been, so I spilled a good amount of it on my hand. I was wearing fabric gloves (that we normally wear when handling things in the -80C freezer) under my usual nitrile gloves, but both of course did absolutely nothing against this stuff. I tried to take them off of my hand as soon as possible, but the nitrile glove had basically shriveled and frozen solid on contact so it took a couple seconds to get everything off. Hurt like hell for a while, and now two days later these dark red areas basically feel like stinging bruises/burns. 

Does anyone here have any similar stories or injuries, and if so, how long did it take to heal and did it leave any lasting marks? I feel pretty dumb for being careless enough to let this happen but I'm grateful it wasn't any worse. I definitely learned my lesson the hard way!",161,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ua9ysg
"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","I dropped a box into a big nitrogen freezer with about 12” of liquid phase in the bottom. I pulled out all the towers, then reached in with my LN2 gloved hand to pick up the box. The box slipped away and the back of my glove went under the liquid when I reached for it, filling the glove with liquid nitrogen. I pulled my hand out and yanked off the glove. I had a perfect burn ring around my arm near the top of the glove. I think the nitrogen in the glove was boiling away, so I only got burned at the LN2 air interface.

"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","I froze the tip of my left thumb once. I was wearing a pair of fabric gloves that were slightly wet, and I had to freeze some samples in liquid nitrogen. However, I had forgotten that the lab had just refilled the nitrogen tank, so when I sank my samples in the tank, I pushed them inside it too far and a lot of cold vapor rose, freezing the water in my gloves. My thumb was frozen-stuck to the glove. It hurt and it took me a while to break the ice crystals in the glove and free my finger. 

It wasn’t as bad as it could be. I didn’t lose my finger or anything like that, but I’m confident I got some degree of nerve damage because my left thumb isn’t as sensitive as my right thumb now. That was almost 4-5 years ago.

edit: I’m reading the comments and it seems that not using gloves is the safest thing to do when handling liquid nitrogen. I wish someone had told me that when I was in that lab, I was just an undergrad at the time.",13,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ua9ysg

Springer Nature Discovers MDPI – The Strain on Scientific Publishing,"Nicely written.

*In a healthy world, other publishers might look at the concern over MDPI and consider how to right the ship. But, dear readers, we do not live in a healthy world. The biggest publishing houses are complicit, and actively contribute, to the current strain (including Elsevier, Frontiers, and more). But we were shocked and dismayed (ok… not shocked, just dismayed) to learn that Springer Nature Portfolio has launched a “Discover” series of journals that seem to deliberately and systematically mimic the MDPI brand.*",96,https://the-strain-on-scientific-publishing.github.io/website/posts/discover_nature/
Can we talk about this for a bit?,"To me, this is another symptom of the current overdrive seen in academia (which is particularly true in biological/biomedical sciences). Getting a permanent position requires an ever-increasing CV with more and better publications. These are getting insanely large (standard is now at least 8 figures with 8 panels each), take longer to do, and harder to publish with increased difficulty and reviewing time.
The fact that this overdrive is now reaching people applying to PhD is bad for the reasons you mention, but they are other which are far worse for academia in itself.
If the requirements increase, people expect the benefits to increase as well. They are not, and worse they are decreasing as well since these are harder to get. And the benefit here I'm talking about is just a fuckin permanent position, something you usually get out of school in any other sector than academia with a simple masters in my place.

My baguette-loving country is in the next stage of this situation. Numbers of PhD students is currently stagnating because of extremely bad job prospects with a PhD here, and the smarter students do not pursue a PhD anymore. One response has been to increase benefits for PhD students, but nothing has been done afterwards. No one is fooled here. Issue is, half the raw research is done by PhD students and postdocs. If they leave in the end, who's going to do experiments?",1051,https://i.redd.it/wqzezh70u5be1.jpeg

Worked a Job, got a good mentor who gave me a great rec and I nailed my GRE, got a good masters paid for. Ended up with my dream job working for one of the two best bionics researchers in the country. He ended up taking a new position (family driven) across the country, and we were not really in a position to move the whole lab. So for two years I was running half of a department. The university wasn't happy, but they also weren't going to rock the boat to hard and have his millions of grant money hit the road too. 

So by the time I got offered a PhD slot I had a solid half dozen papers myself, and maybe 20 more as coauthor. Based on my school transcript, I was a poor candidate, even though I was functionally already doing post PhD level work. Without the 'extra' I'd have never gotten an offer.

When I was in a lab as an undergrad, it was my first time working on research and doing research on my own terms (rather than a classroom setting). I was running a synthesis and had a refluxing aqueous solution boiling away. I had to add a few mls of conc hydrogen peroxide to the minute to oxidize the metal centers in the solution. I missed the word slowly and all at once poured like 5ml of hydrogen peroxide into a 100C reflux. The peroxide all instantly reacted, flushing the entire contents of the reaction flask up and out the top of the condenser column. Fortunately I was using the hood correctly and nobody got hurt, made for a crazy story later.

The current administration will just spin it as academics being lazy and wasting government funds. Further, this administration absolutely will retaliate against you especially if you are here on a visa. 

The key to beat them is to shift public opinion by being as vocal as possible. Trump is extremely mercurial and walks back absolutely everything that hurts his poll ratings (e.g. the tariffs after all they managed to do was to reduce US GDP this quarter).

However, the situation is terrifying. This is something that could literally ruin years of experiments, collapse universities, and flood the already saturated job market with academics fleeing to industry. 

In terms of regulatory slow downs with new policies demanding new assay types, the FDA is understaffed and unprepared to deal with IND proposals using new assays that de emphasize animal work while simultaneously increasing modeling/AI. Large pharma (e.g Pfizer, GSK, Merck) has the capital and international presence to wait out delays or pivot to Europe/Australia.

"Women who work in a lab with physically exhausting conditions, how do you manage painful periods?","Babe I’m sorry. 

Medical conditions are rough and can really affect you. If you’re there and there’s no way out and you have to get something done here are some tips coming from one chronically ill girly to another:

- sit as much as you need. Or stand. Whichever you need. Find that sweet spot or weird angle where you feel like you can breathe a little. Work as much as you can in that position. If that means resetting up your work space then that’s what it takes. Don’t accommodate yourself to the workspace. Make your workspace accommodating to you. It needs to be functional. This can be as little as making things all within arms reach so you don’t have to get up as much.

- another person said this but get a cart. Carrying things can really make it worse. 

- use as many sick days as you can. Sometimes all i needed was a day to recover and come in healed. 

- break up your protocols as much as you can if you need. Yes it’ll take FOREVER but you are ill. If you can make a 13 hour long protocol become a two day or three day protocol and just work weekends. Weigh the pros and cons. 

- other pain management strategies: heat or cold packs. They have travel ones now! Wear comfy clothes! Also. Sometimes just to chew on some ice chips. Also. GET WESTERNIZED MEDICINE. that stuff is amazing for your situation and you need to really self advocate to get it. Hopefully it won’t put you too much in medical debt. 

If your pi gives you crap for this. Go to the accommodations office with a doctors note. They CANNOT make you conform to their standard without an offer for additional accommodations.

"Women who work in a lab with physically exhausting conditions, how do you manage painful periods?","I agree with what other people have said, but since it can take a while for medication to kick in or to get a second opinion, I'd recommend something like the  thermacare heat wraps or a TENS unit for back/period pain. Drink lots of fluids with electrolytes and maybe start a multivitamin or iron supplements (iron biglycinate / glycinate with vitamin c and b12 is gentler on the digestive tract and typically absobs better than ferrous sulfate).

Get a good positive control. Methods like Stain-Free can tell you a lot about your SDS-PAGE separation, and then later about the your transfer— well before primary incubation. After that, get a good blocking agent. Biorad makes a convenient one called EveryBlot. A good specific primary, and a fresh anti-species secondary will send you on your way.

Pain Points of Hiring PhDs,"I’m struggling right now with credential inflation. After about 20 zoom interviews I see that people who say they’re proficient in xyz aren’t at all proficient in xyz. Or they may have done x or y but don’t think very rigorously about the problem. I used computational approaches in my work and it’s important for me to know people know where tools they’ve used break down. But they don’t. 

This leads me to believe I shouldn’t interview anyone whose work isn’t published and who hasn’t set up a public GitHub. But I don’t think that’s a good way to weed people out. I myself didn’t have my big phd paper out until I’d left the lab.

I’d much rather candidates say they’ve had experience with x and want to learn more than for them to declare themselves as proficient. Candidates also need to prepare to be questioned about technical details of their work and what they want out of a lab. I’m finding they don’t.

"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","Man, we had this problem when my PI took over his old PIs lab. Strains labeled just whatever. Thankfully they were at ~least~ put in a labeled box (most of the time). So we started new rules. Strains always get the same two letter code (EC for E. coli, YE for Yersinia enterocolitica, etc) and a number—whatever the next number is available in the Strain Log, which is an excel file we keep with the strain numbers, genetic profiles and brief description (resistance markers, if it was made with P1, etc). This file is on our university’s server and encrypted. Any of us can open it, but only one person can be editing it at a time—which is great because you won’t accidentally take someone else’s number, but does really suck when your colleague leaves it open after he leaves and now you can’t edit it from your computer.",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1co75xi/microbiologists_in_big_labs_how_do_you_keep_your/
"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","We aren't necessarily a large lab, but we have a culture collection of easily 5000 strains by now, after 8 or 9 years. We do a TON of construction, but also collect strains from the environment, or duplicate other heritage collections. 

Strains that we make are given an accession code: GS_01234. GS stands for ""general stock"". This collection is open to lab members and can be shared out to collaborators. We have a digital inventory system (we use Labguru, it's good but a little expensive) that records the strains' info (their genotype, date of collection, etc), and we have a pretty crude but effective way to generate the code number: look in the most recent box in the -80 (which are also numbered ""gs box 24"") for the last gs number, put a placeholder tube (a blank tube with a brightly-painted cap) in place of your new strain, check the inventory record to confirm that the last number is the last record, and then enter the new record, label the tube with the new GS number and any brief strain info for quick verification, replace the placeholder tube with the new stock. The digital record includes the physical location of the stock, but since it is in numerical order it's also easy to just find the GS in the correct box, assuming you know the number.

Before they become general stocks, each student is encouraged to come up with their own personal strain collection (if my name was Mike Johnson, it'd be MJ_0001) for strains they collect/generate/mutate/etc. When they leave our lab, they can take these strains with them (assuming no special proprietary restrictions) to build their own, long-term culture collection. Personal stocks are entered into general stocks once we are sure it's useful and/or correct. 

If we receive strains from other groups, they either get assigned a GS number and are placed in the GS collection, or, if we are not allowed to share it or have to destroy them after use (per MTAs) they go in their own collection. So we actually have about a dozen different small collections outside the GS.

All of these collections are basically just individual cryoboxes in racks in our -80s; the racks are also numbered and organized. We don't really allow each other to leave stuff loose in the -80 freezer - it happens ofc for like one overnight or so but for the most part, everyone has their own cryo boxes and stuff goes inside those. 

It goes without saying, these kinds of systems have to be implemented and followed from the start. I'd tear my hair out if I had to sort out someone else's collection.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1co75xi/microbiologists_in_big_labs_how_do_you_keep_your/

"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","I work in industry. We assign strain numbers to every strain we build when we ""bank"" it as a cryo stock (prefix plus number), log these in our LIMS (but it could just as easily be e.g. a shared Google sheet) with key info - most important being parent strain and a standardized coding of the differential genotype. Our particular system also includes a transformation ID off our transformation sheet which shows in a coded form exactly what DNA was transformed to make it (whether a plasmid, linear DNA, multiple things, whatever). The LIMS is handy because due to the parent ID field, you can click on or search for the strain ID and see the entire lineage of modifications that it derives from. We just store the strains in numerical order in boxes, since we grab the next number out of LIMS when banking. Simplifies racking and maximizing -80 space and retrieving strains for streaking - we print labels marking what numbers are in each rack and box. 

Honestly I would go absolutely bonkers doing this any other way. My small team generates thousands of strains every year (our collection is easily 30000 strains) and everyone builds off each other's work and continuity needs to be maintained despite staff turnover.

"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","Its a nightmare to setup, especially if you have a lab that just numbers everything 1, 2, 3, etc. or date whatever and you get to inventory. But it will save hours weekly at a minimum once you get it setup. I've done this in two labs - one with a PI that was a decades long hoarder - it took about a year. His face when he would walk in rooms and he could visually see where everything was in our imaging, surgery, tissue, and radioactive rooms was the best. It used to be piles everywhere. 

And my current lab that I helped build from the ground up with my PI. Much easier but always refining based on user needs and PI requests. 

1. Google sheet with a quick reference and easy to search data base that details what is where, row, shelf. Links to those boxes with by the row and number detailed data base that is also a google sheet. You can even build it to look like the freezer visually. You can force this into something standardized by creating drop down menus for naming schemes, location, and date selection etc. The only thing manual will be your numbering system and some other details or notes. But you can direct this with menus. 

2. Quick reference laminated guide on the outside of the freezer showing freezer number, rows, numbers, whatever you want etc. 

3. We have back up documents on Teams/SharePoint. The best thing is you can have a simplified sheet. Even use a PDF file too for ease of access if you want on all devices. Lets you know basics and location of what you are looking for. Then you can link this to a specific file in a share drive, teams drive, sharepoint, etc. with the details.

4. Good freezer or labeling tape if you reuse boxes. 

You can do the same with benchling or labarchives.  I just add stuff in experiments and we can link to anything because I add everyone to each file and drive with our shared resources and they'll have access based on login information. Entire experiment on one page like a real notebook - linked to data, harvest, cloning, expansion, colony breeding, grant, protocols, GraphPad results. Makes it so much easier when you have to go back 6 months later and go through it all. 

  
Just make sure you have a nice numbering system, maybe with a legend, it will seem odd and overwhelming at first, but it is a lifesaver. We use it for cloning, pathogens, samples, specific strains, and our mouse colony for cage/strain ID. 

Works great and in a meeting I can bring it up in seconds rather than searching and gathering data, checking locations for 30 minutes and then getting back to my PI. In certain situations - I will even set up auto populating graphs and formulas based on how we update data in these systems so we can just look quickly at counts etc. Google Apps Script is also beneficial with these systems to sync with a lab calendar as a time saver. 

Automation and ease of use will save your life and when these systems work - you have way more time for experiments and those last minute PI requests.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1co75xi/microbiologists_in_big_labs_how_do_you_keep_your/

do y’all do anything for pain in your hands,"Look up nerve gliding techniques on YouTube. Do stretches meant for carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndrome. Every. Single. Day.

Make sure your bench is at a suitable height: higher chair if you're short, lower chair if you're tall. 

When pipetting, instead of letting the [ergonomic grip cover](https://micropipette.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A-modern-day-micropipette-982x1024.jpg) rest on the crook of your forefinger, grip it between your forefinger and middle finger. It decreases the strain on your wrist. (This really helped me but it takes some practice)

If the pipetting step doesn't require accuracy, I switch to the other hand to give my dominant hand a rest.

Check your laptop/computer typing posture. Make sure you're not t-rexing your arms.

Check your sleeping posture. Sleeping on one side or your front will exacerbate symptoms.

If you spend all your time standing in the lab, make sure you're wearing shoes with good support. This is surprisingly important because if you're standing in bad posture you will screw up your shoulder alignment and give yourself issues. 

Lastly, constant exercise, a good diet, good rest. High stress causes high pain.

do y’all do anything for pain in your hands,"As someone with chronic hand pain who pipettes frequently, would reiterate previous comments to seek medical advice if it gets any worse. Catching it early is the most important thing, especially for repetitive strain injury.

Danger signs:
- loss of sensation
- constant pain
- shorter recovery periods between bouts of pain
- specific areas / patterns of pain (keep detailed notes of this as you would your lab data)

Ergonomics / setup things to consider:
- different pipettes (see if you can borrow a different model of pipette from a different lab for a few hours and if you find them more comfortable, ask to get those)
- swapping out fingers used for pipetting
- swapping hands (doesn’t take too long to adjust and post pipettes are ambidextrous)
- take breaks! Swap out different muscle groups e.g. i would do some pipetting and then go water the plants to take a break from it before coming back - it helps to plan your day with these breaks/swaps in mind
- Discuss with supervisor (if you have a good relationship with them, they should be supportive in helping you work with it)

It's really good that you are asking this question and caring for your own health. Once your physical health or hands are fucked it will be an uphill battle (same with mental health btw) to just get back to normal. So you should be more careful to prevent damage or spend 10x the money and time fixing it after.

After starting weightlifting, particularly gymnastics rings calisthenics, I never experienced wrist pain from minor repetitive movements. Mind you, it was very painful at the start but the body is quite resilient, your wrists and forearms would be permanently strengthened to the point where pipetting should never bother you, think it’s got something to do with distribution of force, you start utilizing more of your muscle rather than leveraging on the joints.

Advice on working with injury,"How severe is it? How long ago did you hurt it, and is it still hurting? Is it preventing you from working right now?

If you just hurt it and it isn't totally incapacitating, give it a few days and take it easy. Try stretching it out, otc pain meds, and alternating ice and heat on it and see if that helps. Don't panic. If it is preventing you from working, you should talk to your supervisor to make some adjustments while it heals. But if it is so severe that you can barely move, you should talk to a doctor. 

My personal experience is with my bad SI joint. I sprained it badly a few years ago, and it is easy to sprain now. It flared up while working in my current lab, and every position was painful. The many, many doctors were pretty useless beyond telling me to talk a shit ton of anti-inflammatories. My supervisors were nice enough to let me stick to desk work for a few weeks, but I didn't have any important deadlines at the time. I didn't take any time off. What finally helped was going to a good chiropractor as a last resort. A cheap tens machine I could use at home was also extremely helpful.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1flplc1/advice_on_working_with_injury/

Is there a way to consolidate data from 3 experimental repetitions into 1?,"Assuming the relationships between samples are pretty constant across experiments, but the dataset from each experiment has a different range, you can subtract out the cross-experiment variation and combine them.

I can't give you an exact method without seeing your data, but here's an example: Fit a linear model to all your data where the variable under investigation is explained only by the experiment that each sample came from. That is, make a dummy variable like ""A, B, C"" or ""1, 2, 3"" that indicates which experiment each sample was derived from (e.g. in R: `MyDependentVariable ~ ExperimentNumber`). The residuals of this linear model then contain the variatiom between samples *not* due to idiosyncratic variations betweem individual experiments. Perform the rest of your analysis on the residuals, rather than the initial data. This method is commonly used to combine RNAseq datasets.

Hopefully that gives you a general idea of the process, but you should definitely investigate further on your own before you apply this to your own data. The term you'll want to look up is ""batch effects"", specifically how to *remove* batch effects. If you ask someone who's done RNAseq analysis before (especially combining multiple publicly available datasets) about this, they'll know what you're talking about and be able to give you further instruction.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1bisxv8/is_there_a_way_to_consolidate_data_from_3/

inserting 2nd repetitive sequence into plasmid -- cloning recombination help??,"I would guess the real problem is not during your transformation step. The nature of in-fusion cloning/gibson/related methods make them really hostile to inserting/modifying highly repeated sequences, because the repeats can easily act as the homology-arms and misanneal during the ligation step. Which gives you a ""recombinant"" product.

You might be able to brute-force it by screening dozens of clones but I would suggest that for highly repetitive elements a more traditional restriction-digest + DNA ligase method is better because the homologous sequences are not going to interfere during the assembly. If your region of interest is short and surrounded by two unique sites in your plasmid then you could insert via annealed oligonucleotides with ends complementary to the restriction sites. If the region is large then order it as a gene fragment, amplify the fragment by pcr, and clone the product in via restriction/ligation.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1fet69l/inserting_2nd_repetitive_sequence_into_plasmid/
Is a cell strain necessary for seeding cell culture to a 96-wells plate?,"Cell strainers come in various filtration sizes and are often used prior to FACS to ensure you have a single cell suspension (ie it gets rid of clumps). But this will also reduce your cell concentration post-straining so do your counts after straining. 

I really dont think its necessary though if you mix the suspension well enough. Shaking gently wont cut it, pipette up and down to mix well. Ideally use a sterile trough+multichannel if seeding the whole plate or pipette/mix the suspension after every \~16 wells. 

If you're, having issues with uniform seeding, its far more likely due to pipetting and/or mixing issues rather than clumping imo. But it takes negligible time to strain cells and since uniform seeding is critical for an assay like this, it might be worthwhile to try it out.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1en1b3x/is_a_cell_strain_necessary_for_seeding_cell/

I've had so many things I've wanted to do but was in the past criticized for ""doing too much"" and ""not leaving enough for everyone else to do.""  But now that I don't have to worry about stepping on any toes this place is getting whipped into shape!  I already have a list of what to do next week (in addition to my experiments, of course).",1,https://i.imgur.com/wM3OgHQ.jpg

What’s the biggest mistake you or someone you know has made in the lab?,"So many lol. Mistakes are the best way to learn. A few that come to mind; 

1. I set off a freezer alarm while taking too long to look through the wrong deep freezer, and it sent a silent alarm to the fire department. To this day I don’t know wtf the lab had in there. 

2. Dropped and cracked open a full 500 mL media bottle in front of my supervisor, what a mess. 

3. Sac’d the wrong strain of mouse from a miscommunication on breed names. Just one mouse thankfully. But I’ll remember that one. Poor guy didn’t have to go yet.

Tried to twist it down, ended up spilling most of it into the rotavap bath. 5 hours of extracting disgusting water and a column later I got about 2/3 of it back.

2. Had to clean up a mess where a bottle of something nasty (unidentifiable) broke inside of the storage box with various other nasty chemicals inside. I discovered it and therefore was tasked with the cleanup. Replaced the drying agent in the box and cleaned the other bottles. Reached over and nocked over the bottle of 100 ml of TMEDA (Tetramethylethylendiamine). Reeked horribly and spilled over to the tox bench where they were preparing ridiculously toxic chemicals (nano- to femtomolar toxicity). Bonus: The TMEDA reacted with something in the waste bin.",31,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1f40qre/whats_the_biggest_mistake_you_or_someone_you_know/

Girl was finishing her PhD, waiting to start her postdoc under the condition that her PhD paper would be published. In the final stages of revisions, for whatever reason her experiments just stopped working. Being under pressure to finish, and start her postdoc in order to remain in the country on a visa, she just invented data and sent that. Paper gets published. Two years into her postdoc (at another lab in our university), her former PI gets contacted by a number of people who all independently got absolutely contradicting results in the same experiments that she supposedly did. A short investigation later, the truth was uncovered, she lost her position and her PhD, thus lost her visa and had to move back to her home country. Haven't heard anything about her ever since. Mutual friends said she hasn't even been online in over 3 years.

Normally, the flasks should have a constant weight before using them for the experiment. We achieve this by heating them in the oven at a specific temperature and for a set number of hours, repeating the process two or three times or until their weights become constant. Two of my classmates were impatient and wanted to finish the experiment quickly. Instead of using an oven, they heated the Soxhlet flasks in a FURNACE, reaching temperatures of 500°C. They were confident that the flasks would be okay, but they were wrong. After heating them once, the flasks had dents in their bodies. They were deformed and ultimately could not be used for the experiment. In the end, those classmates had to pay a significant amount to the lab in charge for the destroyed Soxhlet flasks.

Forgot to add restriction enzymes, so none of my adapters ligated (at least I could sell it as a nice control).

Oh yeah, and also not me, but when I did my bachelor’s thesis, the lab tech that was onboarding me was showing me how they lysed E. coli with a sonicator. He had the bacterial pellet in a beaker, that was standing in an icebox. He then inserted the tip of the sonicator and apparently didn’t fully put it in a locked down position, because as soon as he started, the sonicator came loose and smashed through the beaker, soaking the pellet (which I forgot to mention was dissolving in buffer) onto the ice below. He was super embarrassed, but the bacteria were ultimately fine. He just scooped the ice that had been soaked by the bacteria into a larger beaker, added more buffer and then sonicated (without breaking smything).",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1j9ajf8/today_i_dropped_my_96_well_plate_on_the_floor/

Wrist Pain at Work?,"Yes! I’m finishing my PhD this year and have experienced on/off wrist pain constantly which occasionally has flare ups.

I ended up getting a wrist support to wear which helped quite a lot and since doing less pipetting it hasn’t flared up in the lab for a while now (The only other times it flares up is in the gym when lifting weights). 

Definitely keep an eye on it - my dad is an electrician and had carpal tunnel syndrome which developed over years. The doctor said it was from repeated wrist use and using vibrating machinery.
