# LLM-Based-Reddit-Scraper

A Python-based scraper that parses through the subreddit r/labrats and manually classifies comments and posts into common keywords (pain-points) associated with long-term pipetting.

Developed to quantitatively explore the potential barriers of entry into the fields of wet lab, cellular biology and R&D, this project also utilizes prompt-engineering and OpenAI's (GPT-3.5) API to enable LLM-based classification. Concludes with extensive data-visualization through frequency-based bubble charts and word clouds.

Created for UBC iGEM's (International Genetically Engineered Machine) engineering student design team â€“ submitted to the annual iGEM Jamboree'25 as a key deliverable from the Human Practices (EDI) Subteam as well as the Software Subteam.
