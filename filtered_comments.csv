Columbia fires 20% of its lab staff (180 scientists) under strain of federal cuts,"I'm surprised about how tech and VC bros in the administration don't realize that fundamental research form the core of products that go into big pharma/biotech, software/hardware tech startups, etc. I've heard some say that industry seems to be much more efficient in making their dollars into products, but that's only after decades of academic research that mapped out the knowledge landscape allowing those companies to focus on high value targets. I've spoken to at least one medium pharma CEO and their core strategy was to fund/purchase discoveries from labs in their field and lower their own R&D. Moreover, startups that came from an academic labs possess proprietary knowledge despite publications in the area and if these startups are Chinese, then transformational science and tech advances from Chinese companies will dominate the global economy.

  
I'm also surprised about the elephant in the room which is that this academic retaliation entirely stems from the campus Gaza protests. Either protecting Israel from all criticism is valued over long term American science, technology and eventual economic supremacy and/or advocates for this view have incredible influence in the halls of power (which blatant fact will immediately bring calls of antisemitic tropes).",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1kg4nxw/columbia_fires_20_of_its_lab_staff_180_scientists/

Do you wash and reuse pipette tips?,"They are intended to be disposable, yes. But there are a small but growing number of labs trying to reduce their environmental impact by reusing more plastics. You can even buy (crazy expensive) machines for washing tips.

I'd be hesitant to use them for anything really sensitive, DNA/RNA work for example, unless you had a validated protocol for cleaning them. I'd expect a hydrogen peroxide wash to destroy nucleic acids for example.",1439,https://i.redd.it/zj3tm8da90cd1.jpeg
Do you wash and reuse pipette tips?,"During my bachelors, I think we did that as students, but I'm pretty sure the actual researchers used only new tips. They did diagnostics for the hospital there too, so contamination would be unfortunate.",4,https://i.redd.it/zj3tm8da90cd1.jpeg
Do you wash and reuse pipette tips?,"I’ve seen a group in our institute wash and re-use Eppendorf *Combitips advanced* positive-displacement pipette tips because they said that they were expensive, which I thought was unusual, but I guess made some sense, since I think they use them during staining just for washes of PBS, etc.. Though for the stuff that’s centrally-provided by the institute, they don’t save as they don’t have to care about the cost (or the environment… :-/) - they use a single micro-pipette tip per every well of a 96-well plate for qPCR just to help them match and keep their place on the plate, whereas we use the same pipette tip across a whole row per sample, and down in blocks of 3 per target gene (we do triplicates, as we do 384-well qPCR instead). They do save on reagents by just doing a single water-only no-template control per target gene, whereas we do 3 per target gene, because we do the same number of controls as the number of samples.",2,https://i.redd.it/zj3tm8da90cd1.jpeg
Do you wash and reuse pipette tips?,"It’s not unheard of to reuse them in uni labs. The students are obviously taught how to use the pipette correctly and that the tips should be disposed, and when you can use the same tip for multiple samples (like bigger to smaller dilution for example), but since in most classes you don’t need the kind of precision you have in a lab, they can be washed and reused. Not all of the teachers do it ofc (I personally think more should).

I had great fun researching the best plants for my mini ecosystem, and bought a few plants as bare root dormant plants and a few in pots. Some I plant from seed and it becomes a big happy mess. I plant things very close together, so weeding is not much of an issue, and I leave everything standing pretty much over winter. This allows native plants and vegetables alike to self seed and grow with almost no input from me! Love working from home so I can go out on my breaks to observe. Favorite insects?

Is pipetting individually that much better than using a multichannel pipettor?,"I only use a multichannel if the quantity doesn't matter that much, and that's usually the case for PCR. So if I'm doing qpcr, I would use a single channel. The sample degradation thing makes no sense though. However, cutting down on how long it takes for you to set up an experiment will make you work a lot faster. 

96 well plates can be a pain to work with because of the amount of wells you need to keep track of. I'd recommend using a fresh box of tips every time because it allows you to track which wells you've already done if you lose your place.  Also, before you even start pipetting, you should have it mapped out of what goes where, which will over time become second nature. My goal when setting up an experiment is to be able to do all of the pipetting without having to think. If you're constantly having to think about what sample you're on, you'll burn yourself out mentally, and make more mistakes.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1hglppc/is_pipetting_individually_that_much_better_than/
Is pipetting individually that much better than using a multichannel pipettor?,"Bullshit. Multichannel pipettes may have some issues with uneven volumes taken, and such pipettes should not be used. But if yours is working fine, then it is not a problem. Just check visually that the volume is not varying among the tips - most of the differences occur due to the tips loosely attached to the pipette. If all tips are well attached and the pipette is calibrated then the differences will not be bigger then the differences within the same single pipette. Also, PCR reagents definitively will not degrade while you are loading them, lol.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1hglppc/is_pipetting_individually_that_much_better_than/
Is pipetting individually that much better than using a multichannel pipettor?,"I personally feel that using a multichannel when you have lots of samples is more accurate because you can visually see if the liquid is in a straight line across all your tips. Visually scan across the tips after you aspirate and it will be very obvious if one is short or has a bubble.

Fatigue must also not be underestimated as a source of human error. Filling 96-well plates one at a time is torture and you have so many more opportunities to make a mistake if you have to pipette 96 times instead of 8 or 12.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1hglppc/is_pipetting_individually_that_much_better_than/

My first lab assistant position, I was not satisfied with the automatic dishwashers so I washed everything by hand. I've since trained and supervised many lab assistants. Most people are not great at washing dishes. They don't soak or scrub or rinse enough or they forget to rinse with DI or MQ water. In my current lab, if the work is sensitive enough, I wash all my dishes before and after my experiments. I've had enough issues with contamination of pigmented strains from tools that my colleagues washed that i get pretty paranoid about what I use now and I dont always trust the dept autoclaves either.


10% fresh bleach to kill organisms, 1% alconox with effective scrubbing to remove grime, warm tap water rinses with at least 3 of the rinses being free of any visible detergent/bubbles, at least 1 DI rinse, maybe 1 MQ rinse. Of course, it matters what you're using the dishes/tools for, but thats generally what I do before I autoclave flasks that I might grow bacteria in.


I have a set of flasks and centrifuge bottles for making competent cells that i dont use detergent on. Anything going in the LCMS doesn't get detergent.

One of my students in my intro microbio class somehow managed to melt the end of a pipette. Would it be feasible to fix using 3D printer filament?,"Does it work in its current state? Because if it doesn't, you don't have anything to lose if you want to try to get it working again. A temperature-controlled soldering iron could melt the plastic back into place. With a skilled hand and iron in a low-temperature setting, you might not need to add any additional plastic. 3D printing filament makes me nervous because they don't have good properties for scientific work. I would avoid the common ones like PLA and PETG. The only exception I can think of is polypropylene, which most people don't use because it's such a paint to print. Fortunately, your lab is likely full of polypropylene; if you need additional plastic, I would use a soldering iron to steal some plastic from a falcon tube or something similar.

Or buy a replacement part, but experimenting seems like more fun!",1,https://i.redd.it/no868ieb5jxd1.jpeg

Pipettes that have a low resistance to aspiration/dispensing (e.g. Not Gilson or Finnpette-though I actually like the finnpette multichannel).

Rainin is probably most famous/known but are also most expensive if you can trial a few different brands you can find one you like.

If you can't change pipettes in no particular order: 1)Taking breaks more often (do some hand stretches) 2) Switch hands, ambidextrous pipetting may take a bit to get used to but allows the other hand to rest 3) Alternate pipette holding-e.g. using your index finger on the plunger",58,https://i.redd.it/h1blzxx8mdoa1.jpg

My method was to wear the brace full time when I first started and the pain was worst, and that includes during lab work.

Over time I eased up and only wore it for strenuous activity that I knew would irritate it, then I switched to a less supportive brace, then I stopped wearing the brace altogether and I've been able to work well in the lab. When I have a flare now I immediately get back into the brace full time for a few days to rest it and it goes back to baseline.

Nowadays groups will use inbred mouse panels for genetic mapping studies to understand the genetic basis of certain behaviors (think GWAS but in mice).

So it's widely known that genetically different strains of mice behave differently.

"For those who work with mice, do you notice a behavioral or personality difference for different strains?","Yes. C57BL/6’s are always nasty from my experience, a memorable cohort had springs for feet and would leap out of the weighing cups the second I put them down, would damn near break their backs trying to turn and bite my hand while scruffing them, and two mice straight up died from fighting. I told the post-doc I was working with about them and she laughed it off saying I was just jumpy, until she had to go down there to handle them herself. She said one mouse whipped around the second she applied the slightest bit of pressure to its tail and gave her a nasty bite, and that a few of them wouldn’t stop throwing itself against the walls of the weighing cup. There was blood in the cup afterward and she’s pretty sure it was from the mouse claws breaking and cutting their paws. We weren’t doing any crazy manipulations or anything, just collecting poop and taking weights.


In contrast, I ran three different mouse lines containing different knockouts of genes that messed them up behaviorally, and they were not nearly as aggressive and nasty as the BL6s. One line was downright sweet, and I used them to teach others mouse handling because they were so docile. They’d try to wiggle out of your grip sure, but no one got bit by them.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1d0oybb/for_those_who_work_with_mice_do_you_notice_a/

I was wearing fabric gloves (that we normally wear when handling things in the -80C freezer) under my usual nitrile gloves, but both of course did absolutely nothing against this stuff. I tried to take them off of my hand as soon as possible, but the nitrile glove had basically shriveled and frozen solid on contact so it took a couple seconds to get everything off. Hurt like hell for a while, and now two days later these dark red areas basically feel like stinging bruises/burns. 

Does anyone here have any similar stories or injuries, and if so, how long did it take to heal and did it leave any lasting marks?

"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","Posted this before but:  
  
When I was an undergrad, the grad student I was working with asked me to continue sample collections in the field while he attended a conference out of the country.  
  
As the sample had to be flash frozen in N2 and there was a ridiculous amount of them, I had been advised to fill a large Styrofoam cooler with N2 to take with me to the field, so I wouldn't hog the lab's dewars all morning. So on you might imagine my surprise and horror now as halfway down the steps the lid of the cooler shifts, splashing N2 into both of my gloves. As the cooler was full and too large to be sat on the steps, I had to continue down the rest of the way with N2 filled gloves. I placed the cooler down as soon as I could, but the damage was done.  
  
My hands ended up blistering like something that might accompany a 3rd degree burns, and I had a much more difficult time pipetting or doing anything that had to do with hands for months after the fact.  
  
I found out later that I could have apparently died from the blistering(?). I'm not certain how that would have worked, but by Jove is my doctor amazed.  
  
I'm just glad I have my hands still!

"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","I froze the tip of my left thumb once. I was wearing a pair of fabric gloves that were slightly wet, and I had to freeze some samples in liquid nitrogen. However, I had forgotten that the lab had just refilled the nitrogen tank, so when I sank my samples in the tank, I pushed them inside it too far and a lot of cold vapor rose, freezing the water in my gloves. My thumb was frozen-stuck to the glove. It hurt and it took me a while to break the ice crystals in the glove and free my finger. 

It wasn’t as bad as it could be. I didn’t lose my finger or anything like that, but I’m confident I got some degree of nerve damage because my left thumb isn’t as sensitive as my right thumb now. That was almost 4-5 years ago.

"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","Yeah but not to that degree. Worse was some redness, but never really burned myself.

I did have a near miss... Was with an old round N2 storage barrel with 6 towers in it. So old it evaporated quickly so it was filled with liquid N2 to the top instead of storing in gas phase. The towers had the shape of a piece of pie and the rod to keep the boxes fixed in place was in the point/back of the tower. (So you can't see if the boxes are fixated, you have to pull all to check).
So I took the tower out of the barrel, which is something you have to do yanking it out. The tower is heavy because of its size and it is submerched in N2 + the barrel is quite high so you have to pull it far above your shoulder level to get the tower out.
Apperently the person before me didn't check if the fixating rod had indeed gone through all the boxes... so I yanked the tower out and like 3-4 boxes including liquid nitrogen come flying out towards me.
Luckily I have long arms and could jump back a bit + I was wearing jeans, a long sleeved sweater, socks in closed shoes, a labcoat, glasses and good cryo protective gloves. I did get N2 on me, but I didn't get burned. Only some temporary cold spots and minor redness.

Either that or something with which you wash your hands. The pattern of the reaction makes me unsure if it's something that you are touching and handling unless your fingertips are worse.

As far as invalidating results, it depends on your QRA guidance.  You have to follow what is written, if that doesn't allow you file some sort of NCR then that's on two groups.

Air gap after aspirating with pipette,"How old are your pipettes and when was the last time they were serviced?

 This usually happens when the piston needs to be cleaned/greased, or the seal/oring needs to be replaced. When you press the plunger button, you are compressing a spring and pushing the piston through a seal in the shaft of the pipette. The piston return is what creates the suction that aspirates your sample. If the piston is dirty or the grease has gunked up, the piston return is not as smooth as it should be and it can be slower than normal. This can make it feel like you've reached the top of the return, so you remove the pipette from the liquid, but really, the piston is a couple millimeters behind you and continues to aspirate after you've lifted the pipette. The more viscous the liquid, the more susceptible the pipette is to this effect. 

There's probably nothing fundamentally wrong with your technique, but you can adjust it by leaving the pipette tip in the sample for a second or two longer and fully removing your thumb from the plunger completely before removing the tip. This isn't ideal though, really, you should just get the pipette serviced. If it continues after servicing, you probably have an old gilson or Rainin pipette and you probably need to replace the piston, which means you should probably just replace the pipette.

Edit: It could also be a loose calibration/lift rod housing or damaged return spring. Set the pipette to the max volume and shake it up and down like a cocktail. The plunger should be flush against the piston spring in the pipette and it should not move (you shouldn't hear any rattling or noise). If the plunger button bounces up and down, a pretty critical part of the pipette is either loose or damaged. A very skilled tech can fix it, but most of the time, you'll need to replace the pipette.",6,https://i.redd.it/5uukg7l1uj9b1.png

Any tips on putting on gloves when you have sweaty hands?,"Immaculate technique:

1. Wipe hands on pants to get rid of most of the moisture.
2. If alone, flap hands around a bit to accelerate drying.
3. Blow gloves up with air by trapping a bubble of air inside the gloves by holding the wrist end closed, then push it to the fingers to inflate them.
4. Put hand inside as far as you can before getting stuck from moisture grabbing the rubber.
5. Repeat for the other hand, getting your fingers in as far as you can.
6. Use both now-gloved hands to pull the finger rubber into the right spots.

How do you pipette < 1uL liquids fully by “mixing”,"Use low retention tips. If you're sure you have aspirated the correct amount and you're adding it to something else, you can shoot it out, suck it back up and shoot it out a few more times.

Check your technique on a P200 or P1000 @ ~80% capacity (160/800uL) and a 3 or 4 place balance. The number of times I've seen people blame to tools for poor technique is higher than I would like.

Assuming your hand technique is correct, most common issues I see are going too deep when aspirating and not touching the side of receptacle when dispensing. You are supposed to pre-wet the tip but tbh with low volume and low retention tips I have found this to be largely a waste of time.

And mirroring others, use serial dilution if possible.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1jkuu58/how_do_you_pipette_1ul_liquids_fully_by_mixing/

Look at the section for heterogenous sample pipetting. I typically do a minimum of 4 pulses when the solutions are colorless. This is the best way to guarantee that you get all the residue from the pipette

This also covers when reverse pipetting is appropriate (as well as repetitive pipetting)",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1jkuu58/how_do_you_pipette_1ul_liquids_fully_by_mixing/
Pipetting a large volume,You won't get that many sig figs from pipets. Your best bet would be to find a dilution scheme that works with whole number microliters,162,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1jgpsrn/pipetting_a_large_volume/
Pipetting a large volume,"Say your P1000 is ± 8.00 uL ([like this one](https://www.gilson.com/default/pipetman-p1000-100-1000-micro-l-metal-ejector.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqe9CAeq8T9ZV2P5Fl3vCFE_yD6iSotnp869vPFLf2OI8mwL6EM)), then that applies to that specific pipetting step. 

Your most precise pipetting will be by minimizing the number of pipetting steps, so personally, I would do two additions of 878 uL (2x878 =1,756) and call it a day.

If you need greater precision than that, you need to do the work gravimetrically, i.e., using a balance. Unfortunately you'll also need to know the density of the liquid, which is only easy to obtain for pure substances like water.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1jgpsrn/pipetting_a_large_volume/

Can we talk about this for a bit?,"To me, this is another symptom of the current overdrive seen in academia (which is particularly true in biological/biomedical sciences). Getting a permanent position requires an ever-increasing CV with more and better publications. These are getting insanely large (standard is now at least 8 figures with 8 panels each), take longer to do, and harder to publish with increased difficulty and reviewing time.
The fact that this overdrive is now reaching people applying to PhD is bad for the reasons you mention, but they are other which are far worse for academia in itself.
If the requirements increase, people expect the benefits to increase as well. They are not, and worse they are decreasing as well since these are harder to get. And the benefit here I'm talking about is just a fuckin permanent position, something you usually get out of school in any other sector than academia with a simple masters in my place.

My baguette-loving country is in the next stage of this situation. Numbers of PhD students is currently stagnating because of extremely bad job prospects with a PhD here, and the smarter students do not pursue a PhD anymore. One response has been to increase benefits for PhD students, but nothing has been done afterwards. No one is fooled here. Issue is, half the raw research is done by PhD students and postdocs.

The university wasn't happy, but they also weren't going to rock the boat to hard and have his millions of grant money hit the road too. 

So by the time I got offered a PhD slot I had a solid half dozen papers myself, and maybe 20 more as coauthor.
