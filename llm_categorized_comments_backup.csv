PAIN!,"Yes, I’ve worked on development and validation of ELISAs for several years both in regulated bioanalytical settings and research settings. I am by no means a guru but I’m fairly experienced with different ELISA/ECL formats/approaches for different analytes and use cases.

Regarding coating, certainly if the assay is working well for you, it’s not an inherent requirement that you coat at 4C. My primary concern with the RT coating would be how variable that temperature is. You would likely be better off using a 22-25C incubator to maintain a steady temp, if that’s available to you. If it helps you work more efficiently to be able to coat on a Friday so you can run on Monday, then it may be worth testing at 4C. Personally I would take a plate coated at 4C and one coated at RT your usual way, then run the same assay on each plate (standard curve, some representative samples, etc) and see how the results compare between coating methods.

It is hugely important to run a standard curve on each plate for quantitative ELISAs. I don’t know if you’re running the curve on one plate only because you don’t want to prep 2 sets of standards or because you need space on the plate, but I would strongly recommend against using a curve from a different plate even if you’re running them in parallel on the same day. If you’re prepping the standards in buffer, just make a bigger volume and use the same prep for both plates (but both plates should have a curve on them).

It sounds like you’ve done MRD testing (minimum required dilution) but not any real precision testing. Even if you’re not doing a rigorous assay qualification or validation, that’s one of the things I would want to establish at a bare minimum. Especially if you are currently having issues replicating results from assay to assay I think this is worth looking into. Take a few samples you can spare, or order some disease state samples from a company that supplies that type of thing (I could suggest vendors in the US but am not familiar with options in Spain). Take the set of samples and test multiple replicates at the same dilution both on the same plate and on different plates. Ideally you want to test samples at the upper and lower limits of quantitation as well as some in between. This will give you more information on the variability of the assay itself both from well to well on the same plate (intra-assay precision) and from plate to plate (inter-assay precision). For more rigorous qualifications typically you want multiple analysts testing precision on multiple days, but that is quite possibly total overkill for your use case. 

There are other factors too that could be affecting the consistency of results from run to run, like sample stability. If your samples may have variable number of freeze the cycles or varied time at 4C or whatever, it’s helpful understand this at least to some extent.

In general, do you have a good sense of how reliable this assay really needs to be in terms of replicating results? If not, I would suggest having that discussion with your supervisor. Depending on the answer it may be worth doing more extensive assessments of assay performance, or if there’s a fair amount of flexibility as far as results go, it may make sense to do a far more abbreviated assessment to minimize cost. It wouldn’t be AS rigorous but I could probably get the most basic info in 3 plates or therabouts.

With blood samples, are you planning on testing plasma or serum? I totally understand that limited volume can be a challenge, although to be honest that’s not usually an issue with blood. Much easier to get a decent volume of blood compared to stuff like CSF or vitreous fluid.

I’m happy to keep discussing all of this further if you feel it’s helpful. Whatever works for you!",2,https://i.redd.it/7sgxhv79f2i71.jpg,h9hjpfg,h9gj9uo,False,[]

Pain in this area from pipetting? Any tips for avoiding or treating this?,"Wear a brace! I had a similar issue (still do to some capacity but it's hugely improved). My method was to wear the brace full time when I first started and the pain was worst, and that includes during lab work. If you get a brace that immobilizes the wrist but leaves your fingers free you should be able to pipette and a glove a size larger will fit over it. Over time I eased up and only wore it for strenuous activity that I knew would irritate it, then I switched to a less supportive brace, then I stopped wearing the brace altogether and I've been able to work well in the lab. When I have a flare now I immediately get back into the brace full time for a few days to rest it and it goes back to baseline.

Pain in this area from pipetting? Any tips for avoiding or treating this?,"Stretches are critical throughout the working day if you're sitting in one position or undertaking repetitive movements. 

Muscles accumulate bad habits really easily and your body adapts over time thinking that postural changes acquired by working habits are normal ( this is a nontechnical description )

It's not just the isolated muscle group that needs stretching, it's the entire chain of them- once one muscle shortens or tenses, the opposing muscles compensate and lengthen

Start with gently stretching the muscle group of concern ( hand, ball of thumb for pipetting )and work backwards/ upwards through your arm to your neck and spine

You may need professional advice on which stretches work best for you, and how to do them properly. It's absolutely worth getting. Reading a description of a good stretch is one thing, making sure you're doing that work properly is entirely another

Start this habit early in your career, do it regularly and make no apologies for it. It'll save your body, and it'll save your lab a motza in insurance claims- they should be happy you're doing it

"Don't be careless around liquid nitrogen, kids. Anyone else ever have an accident with LN2 before? (injury explanation in comments)","**Full context:** Was using liquid nitrogen in the lab and wasn't being as careful (or as intelligent) as I should've been, so I spilled a good amount of it on my hand. I was wearing fabric gloves (that we normally wear when handling things in the -80C freezer) under my usual nitrile gloves, but both of course did absolutely nothing against this stuff. I tried to take them off of my hand as soon as possible, but the nitrile glove had basically shriveled and frozen solid on contact so it took a couple seconds to get everything off. Hurt like hell for a while, and now two days later these dark red areas basically feel like stinging bruises/burns. 

Does anyone here have any similar stories or injuries, and if so, how long did it take to heal and did it leave any lasting marks?

When LN splashes on bare skin it just falls off harmlessly due to the Leidenfrost effect. If the nitrogen soaks into the fabric you get burned a lot faster. You can dip your bare hand into a vat od nitrogen for a second or two without any harm, I've done that demo during outreach events many times. 

Cryogenic gloves are good for protecting you when you need to grasp something cold and solid, but they are terrible for liquid.

Also, just in case people don't know, immediately after getting a cold burn run cold water over the area for at least a minute or two. It reduces the pain and blistering and it heals a lot faster.",241,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/ua9ysg,i5wibii,i5wbwu1,False,['tools and equipment']

I'm sat at the front of the high school chemistry class as Mr. F is doing a LN2 demo with the hammer and smashing bananas, roses and whatnot we've all seen that before. He takes a beaker around and everyone dips their finger in and back out of the beaker very quickly to feel/understand the Leidenfrost effect. He gets back up to the front of the class, does a reaction that produces O2 gas into a balloon atop a flask and chills the balloon with the LN2 and gets the resulting liquid oxygen into a test tube. Drops a match into the test tube with the small amount of pale blue liquid oxygen and we watch it burns brightly. After that he's pouring out some more LN2 into the beaker and putting some things away and getting ready for the next demo when he very quickly dips his finger into the LN2 to try to get something out of the beaker he dropped in accidentally. He's got the small ball or whatever against the side of the beaker and goes in to get it out a second time. He tries to pull his index finger out along the side of the beaker but it looks to be stuck -frosted- to the side of the beaker. He tries to pull away and is looking panicked trying to get some tongs or something to pry his finger away when I notice and say 'do you need some help?' and the class is very silent and worried now as we all know how long it will take to burn someone. He's wincing in pain trying to get his finger out saying 'aagh' and people are gasping as he finally YANKS HIS FINGER OUT OF THE BEAKER WITH CONDENSATION ROLLING OFF OF IT HE STARTS SCREAMING AND PUTS HIS FROZEN FINGER THAT'S BEEN IN THE LN2 FOR LIKE 20 SECONDS ONTO THE BLACK CHEM LAB TABLE PICKS UP THE HAMMER TO OUR DISBELIEF AND SMASHES HIS FINGER INTO A MILLION PIECES.

Liquid nitrogen was used on one side of a complicated heat/steam/baffles/condensation system that was all surrounded by a water bath. Special, complicated, expensive and fragile glassware. Looked like a stick man with Two round bottom flasks for feet. 

My trainer told me always grab the round bottoms by the neck, never the bottom.  She said, I am telling you this, but know you will probably break one anyway. 

One day, I'm removing everything to clean it. I go to remove the roundbottom that was in the liquid nitrogen bath (would soak just below the neck) and it shattered all around just below the neck. So I grab the round bottom, which had just been in liquid nitrogen, with my bare hand. It rested on the meat of my left (dominant hand) for about 4 seconds. Hurt so bad. Went to the office medical staff and they put burn salve on it ans said keep it moisturized. 

The meat of my thumb had this big, dark looking thing within a few hours. Looked like a bruise but closer to the surface? I had it for about a month I think (this was around 2010). It got firmer and sort of raised, it itched a bit, and then it faded. I expected it to get nasty and peel off but it didn't. 

I can't even tell where it was anymore. After the month if healing, I totally forgot about it.

"For those who work with mice, do you notice a behavioral or personality difference for different strains?","Something like that happened to me, and ever since I ask myself whether the fact that someone is telling me this makes any difference in the actual situation. And sometimes they're an expert and I don't know anything. But most of the time, they have at best as good an idea or judgement as I do.
     
I pay close attention now when people tell me what or how to do things or how things work.  Often, they insist that their way is right and rationalize any evidence to the contrary. ""I've been doing this for 25 years...""
   
And when my way works just like I say it will, then their response is some sort of ""Okay. Well, yeah, sure..."" as if they haven't just been aggressively arguing about something they were  caught knowing nothing about.
    
So I overlap the two in my mind at the beginning. And I see that it's always my fault if I listen to someone who leads me astray from my own sense of what's right.
    
Especially safety things. It's chilling when people argue that something is fine and safe just because it's never been an issue for them so far.

The biggest publishing houses are complicit, and actively contribute, to the current strain (including Elsevier, Frontiers, and more). But we were shocked and dismayed (ok… not shocked, just dismayed) to learn that Springer Nature Portfolio has launched a “Discover” series of journals that seem to deliberately and systematically mimic the MDPI brand.*",97,https://the-strain-on-scientific-publishing.github.io/website/posts/discover_nature/,mym30ao,1lf7qvh,False,[]
Can we talk about this for a bit?,"To me, this is another symptom of the current overdrive seen in academia (which is particularly true in biological/biomedical sciences). Getting a permanent position requires an ever-increasing CV with more and better publications. These are getting insanely large (standard is now at least 8 figures with 8 panels each), take longer to do, and harder to publish with increased difficulty and reviewing time.
The fact that this overdrive is now reaching people applying to PhD is bad for the reasons you mention, but they are other which are far worse for academia in itself.
If the requirements increase, people expect the benefits to increase as well. They are not, and worse they are decreasing as well since these are harder to get. And the benefit here I'm talking about is just a fuckin permanent position, something you usually get out of school in any other sector than academia with a simple masters in my place.

My baguette-loving country is in the next stage of this situation. Numbers of PhD students is currently stagnating because of extremely bad job prospects with a PhD here, and the smarter students do not pursue a PhD anymore. One response has been to increase benefits for PhD students, but nothing has been done afterwards. No one is fooled here. Issue is, half the raw research is done by PhD students and postdocs.

The peroxide all instantly reacted, flushing the entire contents of the reaction flask up and out the top of the condenser column.

We used benzyl cyanide, which is every bit as poisonous as it sounds (and was also involved in the described mishap). Uni would just hand you the most poisonous crap a couple months in, im surprised no one got hurt worse than they did.

The current administration will just spin it as academics being lazy and wasting government funds. Further, this administration absolutely will retaliate against you especially if you are here on a visa. 

The key to beat them is to shift public opinion by being as vocal as possible. Trump is extremely mercurial and walks back absolutely everything that hurts his poll ratings (e.g. the tariffs after all they managed to do was to reduce US GDP this quarter).

However, the situation is terrifying. This is something that could literally ruin years of experiments, collapse universities, and flood the already saturated job market with academics fleeing to industry. 

In terms of regulatory slow downs with new policies demanding new assay types, the FDA is understaffed and unprepared to deal with IND proposals using new assays that de emphasize animal work while simultaneously increasing modeling/AI. Large pharma (e.g Pfizer, GSK, Merck) has the capital and international presence to wait out delays or pivot to Europe/Australia. Small biotechs are going to burn their capital on payroll alone waiting for FDA response which could tank companies with six months to a year of runaway that are hoping for trial approval to get their next capital investment round.

One of the things i often share with people about my cynicism of politcal class solidarity movements is that affluent class individuals will only rally with us impoverished POC communities the moment their affluent privileges are affected, and historically the same communities that join the plight of our movements have always abandoned us the moment politicians offer economic relief for the slowly shrinking middle class and upward. Class solidarity calls from people in the middle class and of other privileged backgrounds only last so long because the moment privileged individuals get theirs, they leave us behind and tell our communities to be grateful for what little crumbs we have.

I am privileged because i have circumstancially been offered  the opportunities to contine my education, opportunities thats others aren't so lucky to have. But i still live a financially strained low income life because i continue to choose working in communities that are disinvested in, so when i see on reddit people making these calls to action...my first and foremost question is always ""Do you truly care about class and worker solidarity?

Medical conditions are rough and can really affect you. If you’re there and there’s no way out and you have to get something done here are some tips coming from one chronically ill girly to another:

- sit as much as you need. Or stand. Whichever you need. Find that sweet spot or weird angle where you feel like you can breathe a little. Work as much as you can in that position. If that means resetting up your work space then that’s what it takes. Don’t accommodate yourself to the workspace. Make your workspace accommodating to you. It needs to be functional. This can be as little as making things all within arms reach so you don’t have to get up as much.

- another person said this but get a cart. Carrying things can really make it worse. 

- use as many sick days as you can. Sometimes all i needed was a day to recover and come in healed. 

- break up your protocols as much as you can if you need. Yes it’ll take FOREVER but you are ill. If you can make a 13 hour long protocol become a two day or three day protocol and just work weekends. Weigh the pros and cons. 

- other pain management strategies: heat or cold packs. They have travel ones now! Wear comfy clothes! Also. Sometimes just to chew on some ice chips. Also. GET WESTERNIZED MEDICINE. that stuff is amazing for your situation and you need to really self advocate to get it. Hopefully it won’t put you too much in medical debt. 

If your pi gives you crap for this. Go to the accommodations office with a doctors note. They CANNOT make you conform to their standard without an offer for additional accommodations.

When I was in 7th grade my periods were so painful that I remember sitting in class and gripping the desk with all my strength to try to cope with the pain.

Pain Points of Hiring PhDs,"I’m struggling right now with credential inflation. After about 20 zoom interviews I see that people who say they’re proficient in xyz aren’t at all proficient in xyz. Or they may have done x or y but don’t think very rigorously about the problem. I used computational approaches in my work and it’s important for me to know people know where tools they’ve used break down. But they don’t. 

This leads me to believe I shouldn’t interview anyone whose work isn’t published and who hasn’t set up a public GitHub. But I don’t think that’s a good way to weed people out. I myself didn’t have my big phd paper out until I’d left the lab.

I’d much rather candidates say they’ve had experience with x and want to learn more than for them to declare themselves as proficient. Candidates also need to prepare to be questioned about technical details of their work and what they want out of a lab. I’m finding they don’t.

"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","We aren't necessarily a large lab, but we have a culture collection of easily 5000 strains by now, after 8 or 9 years. We do a TON of construction, but also collect strains from the environment, or duplicate other heritage collections. 

Strains that we make are given an accession code: GS_01234. GS stands for ""general stock"". This collection is open to lab members and can be shared out to collaborators. We have a digital inventory system (we use Labguru, it's good but a little expensive) that records the strains' info (their genotype, date of collection, etc), and we have a pretty crude but effective way to generate the code number: look in the most recent box in the -80 (which are also numbered ""gs box 24"") for the last gs number, put a placeholder tube (a blank tube with a brightly-painted cap) in place of your new strain, check the inventory record to confirm that the last number is the last record, and then enter the new record, label the tube with the new GS number and any brief strain info for quick verification, replace the placeholder tube with the new stock. The digital record includes the physical location of the stock, but since it is in numerical order it's also easy to just find the GS in the correct box, assuming you know the number.

Before they become general stocks, each student is encouraged to come up with their own personal strain collection (if my name was Mike Johnson, it'd be MJ_0001) for strains they collect/generate/mutate/etc. When they leave our lab, they can take these strains with them (assuming no special proprietary restrictions) to build their own, long-term culture collection. Personal stocks are entered into general stocks once we are sure it's useful and/or correct. 

If we receive strains from other groups, they either get assigned a GS number and are placed in the GS collection, or, if we are not allowed to share it or have to destroy them after use (per MTAs) they go in their own collection. So we actually have about a dozen different small collections outside the GS.

All of these collections are basically just individual cryoboxes in racks in our -80s; the racks are also numbered and organized. We don't really allow each other to leave stuff loose in the -80 freezer - it happens ofc for like one overnight or so but for the most part, everyone has their own cryo boxes and stuff goes inside those.

There are some empty spaces in the freezer boxes but it’s organized okay besides that.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1co75xi/microbiologists_in_big_labs_how_do_you_keep_your/,l3dtqrx,1co75xi,False,[]
"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","I work in industry. We assign strain numbers to every strain we build when we ""bank"" it as a cryo stock (prefix plus number), log these in our LIMS (but it could just as easily be e.g. a shared Google sheet) with key info - most important being parent strain and a standardized coding of the differential genotype. Our particular system also includes a transformation ID off our transformation sheet which shows in a coded form exactly what DNA was transformed to make it (whether a plasmid, linear DNA, multiple things, whatever). The LIMS is handy because due to the parent ID field, you can click on or search for the strain ID and see the entire lineage of modifications that it derives from. We just store the strains in numerical order in boxes, since we grab the next number out of LIMS when banking. Simplifies racking and maximizing -80 space and retrieving strains for streaking - we print labels marking what numbers are in each rack and box. 

Honestly I would go absolutely bonkers doing this any other way. My small team generates thousands of strains every year (our collection is easily 30000 strains) and everyone builds off each other's work and continuity needs to be maintained despite staff turnover. I ran a strain engineering team in academia before too and we similarly had a numbering system and strain database.

"Microbiologists in big labs, how do you keep your strains straight?","Its a nightmare to setup, especially if you have a lab that just numbers everything 1, 2, 3, etc. or date whatever and you get to inventory. But it will save hours weekly at a minimum once you get it setup. I've done this in two labs - one with a PI that was a decades long hoarder - it took about a year. His face when he would walk in rooms and he could visually see where everything was in our imaging, surgery, tissue, and radioactive rooms was the best. It used to be piles everywhere. 

And my current lab that I helped build from the ground up with my PI. Much easier but always refining based on user needs and PI requests. 

1. Google sheet with a quick reference and easy to search data base that details what is where, row, shelf. Links to those boxes with by the row and number detailed data base that is also a google sheet. You can even build it to look like the freezer visually. You can force this into something standardized by creating drop down menus for naming schemes, location, and date selection etc. The only thing manual will be your numbering system and some other details or notes. But you can direct this with menus. 

2. Quick reference laminated guide on the outside of the freezer showing freezer number, rows, numbers, whatever you want etc. 

3. We have back up documents on Teams/SharePoint. The best thing is you can have a simplified sheet. Even use a PDF file too for ease of access if you want on all devices. Lets you know basics and location of what you are looking for. Then you can link this to a specific file in a share drive, teams drive, sharepoint, etc. with the details.

4. Good freezer or labeling tape if you reuse boxes. 

You can do the same with benchling or labarchives.  I just add stuff in experiments and we can link to anything because I add everyone to each file and drive with our shared resources and they'll have access based on login information. Entire experiment on one page like a real notebook - linked to data, harvest, cloning, expansion, colony breeding, grant, protocols, GraphPad results. Makes it so much easier when you have to go back 6 months later and go through it all. 

  
Just make sure you have a nice numbering system, maybe with a legend, it will seem odd and overwhelming at first, but it is a lifesaver. We use it for cloning, pathogens, samples, specific strains, and our mouse colony for cage/strain ID. 

Works great and in a meeting I can bring it up in seconds rather than searching and gathering data, checking locations for 30 minutes and then getting back to my PI. In certain situations - I will even set up auto populating graphs and formulas based on how we update data in these systems so we can just look quickly at counts etc. Google Apps Script is also beneficial with these systems to sync with a lab calendar as a time saver. 

Automation and ease of use will save your life and when these systems work - you have way more time for experiments and those last minute PI requests.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1co75xi/microbiologists_in_big_labs_how_do_you_keep_your/,l3f34th,1co75xi,False,"['training and support', 'tools and equipment', 'environmental factors', 'postural issues', 'workload and hours']"

do y’all do anything for pain in your hands,"Look up nerve gliding techniques on YouTube. Do stretches meant for carpal tunnel and cubital tunnel syndrome. Every. Single. Day.

Make sure your bench is at a suitable height: higher chair if you're short, lower chair if you're tall. 

When pipetting, instead of letting the [ergonomic grip cover](https://micropipette.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A-modern-day-micropipette-982x1024.jpg) rest on the crook of your forefinger, grip it between your forefinger and middle finger. It decreases the strain on your wrist. (This really helped me but it takes some practice)

If the pipetting step doesn't require accuracy, I switch to the other hand to give my dominant hand a rest.

Check your laptop/computer typing posture. Make sure you're not t-rexing your arms.

Check your sleeping posture. Sleeping on one side or your front will exacerbate symptoms.

If you spend all your time standing in the lab, make sure you're wearing shoes with good support. This is surprisingly important because if you're standing in bad posture you will screw up your shoulder alignment and give yourself issues. 

Lastly, constant exercise, a good diet, good rest. High stress causes high pain.

Danger signs:
- loss of sensation
- constant pain
- shorter recovery periods between bouts of pain
- specific areas / patterns of pain (keep detailed notes of this as you would your lab data)

Ergonomics / setup things to consider:
- different pipettes (see if you can borrow a different model of pipette from a different lab for a few hours and if you find them more comfortable, ask to get those)
- swapping out fingers used for pipetting
- swapping hands (doesn’t take too long to adjust and post pipettes are ambidextrous)
- take breaks! Swap out different muscle groups e.g. i would do some pipetting and then go water the plants to take a break from it before coming back - it helps to plan your day with these breaks/swaps in mind
- Discuss with supervisor (if you have a good relationship with them, they should be supportive in helping you work with it)

It's really good that you are asking this question and caring for your own health. Once your physical health or hands are fucked it will be an uphill battle (same with mental health btw) to just get back to normal. So you should be more careful to prevent damage or spend 10x the money and time fixing it after.

&#x200B;

Academic labs really don't give a fuck about you, there is a constant stream of doe-eyed exploitable replacements. That said, it never hurts to ask for any of the stuff people mentioned here. What experiments are you doing btw?

&#x200B;

You should also start with the free stuff like learning proper posture and ergonomics and apply them to all aspects of your life (like gaming or reddit scrolling). Stretches and generally being fit/active will also help. 

&#x200B;

If possible, try to minimize needless work by being more mindful/careful.

Still go to a physician if it worries you/causes trouble with work.

When you go, mention your job and the kind of repetitive motion it entails. Describe the degree of pain and how much/if it limits your ability to work or do day-to-day activities. 

Unfortunately, for (most) repetitive strain injuries, since they tend to be joint issues, there's basically only 2 approaches to treatment:

1) Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. Paired with ""do the thing less"" and ""take some NSAIDs.""

2) Surgery.

Advice on working with injury,"How severe is it? How long ago did you hurt it, and is it still hurting? Is it preventing you from working right now?

If you just hurt it and it isn't totally incapacitating, give it a few days and take it easy. Try stretching it out, otc pain meds, and alternating ice and heat on it and see if that helps. Don't panic. If it is preventing you from working, you should talk to your supervisor to make some adjustments while it heals. But if it is so severe that you can barely move, you should talk to a doctor. 

My personal experience is with my bad SI joint. I sprained it badly a few years ago, and it is easy to sprain now. It flared up while working in my current lab, and every position was painful. The many, many doctors were pretty useless beyond telling me to talk a shit ton of anti-inflammatories. My supervisors were nice enough to let me stick to desk work for a few weeks, but I didn't have any important deadlines at the time. I didn't take any time off.

Is there a way to consolidate data from 3 experimental repetitions into 1?,"Assuming the relationships between samples are pretty constant across experiments, but the dataset from each experiment has a different range, you can subtract out the cross-experiment variation and combine them.

I can't give you an exact method without seeing your data, but here's an example: Fit a linear model to all your data where the variable under investigation is explained only by the experiment that each sample came from. That is, make a dummy variable like ""A, B, C"" or ""1, 2, 3"" that indicates which experiment each sample was derived from (e.g. in R: `MyDependentVariable ~ ExperimentNumber`). The residuals of this linear model then contain the variatiom between samples *not* due to idiosyncratic variations betweem individual experiments. Perform the rest of your analysis on the residuals, rather than the initial data. This method is commonly used to combine RNAseq datasets.

Hopefully that gives you a general idea of the process, but you should definitely investigate further on your own before you apply this to your own data. The term you'll want to look up is ""batch effects"", specifically how to *remove* batch effects. If you ask someone who's done RNAseq analysis before (especially combining multiple publicly available datasets) about this, they'll know what you're talking about and be able to give you further instruction.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1bisxv8/is_there_a_way_to_consolidate_data_from_3/,kvqfdkw,1bisxv8,False,['training and support']

Here in Germany it's a 2-3 year apprenticeship. You basically learn the important fundamentals of biology and chemistry as well as general lab stuff like lots of lab safety, sterilisation processes, keeping proper lab journals, making all kinds solutions and buffers, how the different machines and equipment work, working with different measuring methods like pH, photometry and microscopy and processing data. It's mostly done by being in school full-time and half of the time is lectures to teach the theoretical stuff and the other half is practical lab work focused on teaching you how to properly work and being confident and skilled using the different methods.
It's really great because a lot of those things aren't really taught in university or just really quickly and you have to get mist of your experience from jobs and internships you'd have to do on your own. They aren't planned so unless you actively decide to do that and get that experience you only have a bit of  lab experience before your bachelor thesis. All lab work during the bachelor is in big courses of like 50 people and often in groups so you get little to no direct feedback and you only do things once.

During my apprenticeship we spent the first week half of the day learning how to use pipettes correctly, how to use the precision scales, measure fluids exactly and how to properly use centrifuges. That was really great because we had lots of possibilities to just figure things out. Like we used water, ethanol, regular cooking oil, some dye and some non-sterile Eppendorf cups and old 96-well plates to practice pipetting accurately. Like we had to pipette a specific volume into the cup and weigh it to see how accurate we are. Or do serial dilutions and measure with the photometer how well we did. Just lots of time and feedback to get the basics in. In my bachelor how to use a pipette was explained on one slide and you were just supposed to know how to. 
We also spend a month on PCR and used several different methods so we'd be all confident in using different methods and protocols.
I don't know how many gels I ran, plates I poured, lab journals I had to get graded and such. You really get to know everything important. It's really nice to be confident about all the basics and to also understand how they work and why, as well as learning how to troubleshoot and where common mistakes could be.

Most schools also offer internships as part of the degree where you spend several months each in one lab and get practical experience. In my school we had to spend 4 months each in 3 different labs. So you learned even more there and could learn special techniques and skills. They were all partners of the school too so it was guaranteed to be a good lab and they were prepared to teach you things and treat you like a regular lab member and not some intern.

It also helps a lot when you decide to study biology or medicine later. Here you have to pass a test to be able to study medicine and many use it as preparation. I went on to study biology and had more than half of my credit points already. I only had to fill in some more specific courses like ecology, structure of invertebrates and such so you could in theory get your bachelors in two instead of three years or enjoy a way more relaxed schedule",8,https://i.redd.it/bui9c9pe5eea1.jpg,j60432e,j5yneqf,False,"['training and support', 'tools and equipment']"

inserting 2nd repetitive sequence into plasmid -- cloning recombination help??,"I would guess the real problem is not during your transformation step. The nature of in-fusion cloning/gibson/related methods make them really hostile to inserting/modifying highly repeated sequences, because the repeats can easily act as the homology-arms and misanneal during the ligation step. Which gives you a ""recombinant"" product.

You might be able to brute-force it by screening dozens of clones but I would suggest that for highly repetitive elements a more traditional restriction-digest + DNA ligase method is better because the homologous sequences are not going to interfere during the assembly. If your region of interest is short and surrounded by two unique sites in your plasmid then you could insert via annealed oligonucleotides with ends complementary to the restriction sites. If the region is large then order it as a gene fragment, amplify the fragment by pcr, and clone the product in via restriction/ligation.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1fet69l/inserting_2nd_repetitive_sequence_into_plasmid/,lmwnm0h,1fet69l,False,[]
Is a cell strain necessary for seeding cell culture to a 96-wells plate?,"Cell strainers come in various filtration sizes and are often used prior to FACS to ensure you have a single cell suspension (ie it gets rid of clumps). But this will also reduce your cell concentration post-straining so do your counts after straining. 

I really dont think its necessary though if you mix the suspension well enough. Shaking gently wont cut it, pipette up and down to mix well. Ideally use a sterile trough+multichannel if seeding the whole plate or pipette/mix the suspension after every \~16 wells. 

If you're, having issues with uniform seeding, its far more likely due to pipetting and/or mixing issues rather than clumping imo. But it takes negligible time to strain cells and since uniform seeding is critical for an assay like this, it might be worthwhile to try it out.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1en1b3x/is_a_cell_strain_necessary_for_seeding_cell/,lh2x144,1en1b3x,False,['tools and equipment']

Now job and grant funding feels like an unrealistic dream. Even if I avoid health disparities topics, will I even get funding as a trans scientist in the future?

Any tips for working in a lab with chronic pain? ,"I have accommodations currently for my ADHD, so I'm familiar with that process, but I don't have an official diagnosis for my pain so was hoping to avoid going through that channel. My mentor & lab manager are really great, so I don't *think* they would actually give me issues. Especially now that I've worked with them for over a semester, I just want to figure out what to ask for, before bringing it up.

Yeah, no problem! The main things are when I'm having to handle & hold things up kind of far from my body, or things that require me to work directly on the counter for extended periods of time, without being able to move around much. So like with the fumehood, I'm often adding acids to many samples and will have to keep my arms up and extended while doing so(and limited range of motion to keep the fume hood door down). For one handed tasks(like pippeting) I manage by standing at a 45 degree angle and use my side/hip to support my arm. But things that require two hands like transferring between vessels or visual measuring, there's not much I can do. Now working on the counters hurts because I'm a bit tall and they're hip level to me. For whatever reason working with my arms together at that level for awhile also hurts. This one isn't as common thankfully, but is an issue when it happens. 

While standing for long periods hurts, I'm used to it and it isn't typically that bad. I think the issue is tasks that change my center of gravity, or my posture for extended periods.

I would definitely see if a chair would be possible for some of the extended protocols and also just ask them if there are any steps that could be broken up to give you more frequent breaks. Another thing you could ask about is an anti-fatigue standing mat. Moveable support bars could be an option for when you need something to grab for support that would give you a clean surface to use. For things in the hood I'd ask them about positioning and what they may have ideas to shift things around for you. Tweaking setups for individuals is a common enough thing they may already have ideas",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1bas2s6/any_tips_for_working_in_a_lab_with_chronic_pain/,ku4uo59,ku4syaq,False,[]

What’s the biggest mistake you or someone you know has made in the lab?,"It's a little different than that. It's an advanced lab course. At my uni the students get different synthesis for this. Basically, they all get the same number of ""steps"", I think it's 12 in total. That means you could for example get two 2-step reactions and two 4-step reactions which you have to do over the semester. But the professor makes sure that no students get the exact same reactions in a single semester. 

For the 4-step and 5-step reactions (5 is the maximum the students can get for a single synthesis) they usually start with a pretty large reaction volume, since they are unexperienced and their yield is generally not very high. That's why that student had to use so much DCM. Sometimes they are also allowed to dry solvents in groups. So if two students for example need 500 mL THF and DCM each for their synthesis, one can dry 1L of THF and one can dry 1L of DCM. The professor made this rule to encourage team work among the students. So maybe she was drying that DCM for several students at once.",13,https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/1f40qre/whats_the_biggest_mistake_you_or_someone_you_know/,lkjulrh,lkiow4g,False,[]

Of course, for research purposes you would start small but these synthesis are more or less for training.

NIH F31-Diversity apps pulled from review cycle,"Again, I know the current situation with Trump is insane and completely unprecedented, and I of course respect that many PIs (like trainees) are scared, confused and unsure of what to do, and I get being paralyzed by those feelings and feeling powerless (def the point of why Trump and the Repubs are doing this). But on a broad level, I'd say I'd wish more PIs and faculty in general would wake up and realize that they aren't in the club like they think they are, and to start thinking about how they can form and support worker solidarity and union efforts in academia. Because as crazy as the notion may seem to them, they are workers too. They're also shit on by the admins, and I hate how many PIs seem to think that's not the case. Perhaps it comes from just the general toxic punching down/""gotta pay your dues"" culture of academia that you just can't escape when you get in the PI hot seat (w/ all the stress making it hard to resist), or that maybe many of these PIs today do in fact come from very wealthy backgrounds (or have a wealthy partner) and so they think of themselves as not workers, but like the admins themselves and worthy of being seen and treated as the wealthy successful academics they think they deserve to be (ego also doesn't help this, haha). I'd just want to see more PIs wake up to the idea that grad student and post doc and staff unions don't actually hurt them, but help make things better and more fair for folks as a whole, which will ultimately make for happier and more productive people in their labs. And maybe, if they can (I know some unis have weird rules about faculty unions), they can get over themselves enough to realize that they too deserve union protections, and that these ideas are popular and a net GOOD for academia and the US as a whole. And it's something not too crazy to see happening, just look at Rutgers. A few years back, students, postdocs, staff and faculty all started union drives and went on strike at the same time and BOOM, the admins immediately caved and gave them what they wanted. Because we all have the power and they know that! Hard to turn people against each other to keep furthering admin's fuckery when all the workers support one another!

I'm going on too long here, but the final point aside from that is, I'd love to see more PIs get actively involved in communicating with the public and with federal officials. I.e. go to (or help create tele working groups to communicate with) Washington to speak with elected officials in Congress and the Senate about the importance of research. Fight for more funding! Educate yourself on these issues and pass that education to your trainees, and tell them how and who to write to to ask for science support. Make an event of it in lab meeting or advocate for the depart to do a little phonebanking drive! Go to the NIH or communicate with reps there to make your voices heard about needs for funding reform, study section reform and more equity for trainees. At the very least, know when certain working groups meet (like the one that recently discussed postdoc pay increases) and find a way to contribute to it OR at least learn about what it's doing, when its meeting and how you and your trainees can provide feedback and encourage that participation (even via a little Slack message reminder or update). Little things, IMO, to inspire yourself as a PI and your trainees to take a more active role in demanding support and change, because hey, this is your livelihood: govt funding and support. You should know about it and make sure your trainees do too, so everyone can create a culture of advocating for and educating each other.",-11,https://i.redd.it/6i2ntzobdfhe1.jpeg,mb85f4a,mb818q9,False,
